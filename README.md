# Pathfinder 2nd Edition Utility

This is an ambitious side project to capture the rule system for PF2e into a library for use in other projects. I plan to build on the .NET Core framework to enable cross-platform use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Why PF2e?

I heavily have played first edition of Pathfinder but feel there is currently too much source material to consider and would like to enjoy concurrently reading and learning the new system while outlining it in code.

## Objectives

These will grow with time and hopefully turn into Issues as this evolves.

1. Acquire Core Rule Book
2. Rough idea of objectives to cover in first iteration.
   * Outline properties common to all creatures
   * Outline combat/action system and interaction
   * Outline conditions and effects

## Grand Ideas

Just a smattering of ideas I would like to create using this library once complete.

* Character Manager
* GM NPC/Monster Manager
* Integrate Dice Roller
* Network Managers Together (i.e. GM and players can "share" virtually)
* VTT Integration (Ideally want this to be for a TV built into table or projector)
* AR Capability using all of the above

## But why not use the Playtest to start?

I didn't learn the Playtest well enough to begin and aggregating all the edits seemed more hassle than it's worth. Also, would like to start fresh on all of this to hopefully devlope this concurrentl with my understand of the new system.
