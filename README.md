# Pathfinder 2nd Edition Utility

This is an ambitious side project to capture the rule system for PF2e into a library for use in other projects. I plan to build on the .NET Core framework since to enable cross-platform use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Why PF2e?

I heavily have played first edition of Pathfinder but feel there is currently too much source material to consider and would like to enjoy concurrently reading and learning the new system while outlining it in code.

## Objectives

1. Acquire Core Rule Book
2. Rough idea of objectives to cover in first iteration.
   * Outline properties common to all creatures
   * Outline combat/action system and interaction
   * Outline conditions and effects

## Grand Ideas

Just a smattering of ideas I would like to create using this library once complete.

* Character Manager
* GM NPC/Monster Manager
* Integrate Dice Roller
* Network Managers Together (i.e. GM and players can "share" virtually)
* VTT Integration (Ideally want this to be for a TV built into table or projector)
* AR Capability using all of the above
